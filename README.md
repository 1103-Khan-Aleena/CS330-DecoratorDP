CS330 HW2 Decorator Design Pattern
This is my submission for the CS 330 Design Patterns course. The program demonstrates the Decorator Design Pattern by allowing the calculation of the total price of a tree with any combination of decorations. A key constraint is that if a user attempts to add a second star to the tree, the program will issue a warning indicating that the tree already has a star, and the additional star will not be added to the total price.
