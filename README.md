CS330 HW2 Decorator Design Pattern
This is my submission for CS 330 Design Patterns Class. In this program I am using a decorator design pattern that will let me calculate the price of any 
tree plus any combination of decorations. With the limitations of when a user
wants to decorate a tree with a star with a new star I must print a
warning that the tree already has a star and not add the price of a star to
tree.
