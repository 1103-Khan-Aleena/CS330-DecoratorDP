# CS 330 Design Patterns - Decorator Design Pattern

This program is a submission for the CS 330 Design Patterns course. It demonstrates the Decorator Design Pattern by allowing users to add various decorations to a tree and calculate the total cost dynamically.

A key feature of the program is that it prevents adding multiple stars: if a user tries to add a second star, the program displays a warning indicating that the tree already has a star, and the additional star is not added to the description or total price.

This project highlights the flexibility of the Decorator Pattern in extending object behavior without modifying existing code.
